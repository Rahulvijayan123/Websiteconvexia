  - Emerging Modalities (ADC Platform, BiTE Technology, ProTAC Degraders)
  - Regulatory Pathways (Breakthrough Designation, Fast Track Status, Priority Review)
  - Market Access (Pricing Strategy, Reimbursement Plans, Patient Access)
  - Manufacturing (Scale-up Plans, CMC Strategy, Supply Chain)
  - Clinical Strategy (Trial Design, Patient Recruitment, Endpoints)
  - Commercial Planning (Launch Strategy, Sales Force, Marketing)
- **Consistent blur styling** matching the Deal Activity section
- **Professional appearance** with varied opacity levels (60% to 25%)

## 2. Logic Layer Failures - Systematic Solution

### ✅ Dedicated Logic Scoring Layer
**File**: `lib/logicScoringLayer.ts`

**Key Features**:
- **Comprehensive validation** across 6 critical areas:
  1. Mathematical Consistency
  2. Business Logic Compliance  
  3. Cross-Field Consistency
  4. PRV Eligibility Logic
  5. Revenue Projection Validation
  6. Patient Calculation Logic

**Detection Capabilities**:
- ✅ **Market size inconsistencies** (e.g., $2.1B market with 13.5% CAGR but peak revenue also $2.1B)
- ✅ **PRV eligibility contradictions** (e.g., patient count >200,000 but PRV says "Valid. Not eligible")
- ✅ **Mathematical calculation errors** (CAGR, revenue projections, patient counts)
- ✅ **Cross-field consistency issues** (geographic splits, market shares)
- ✅ **Business logic violations** (pricing logic, patient count epidemiology)

### ✅ Integration with Enhanced Pharma Orchestrator
**File**: `lib/enhancedPharmaOrchestrator.ts`

**Systematic Flow**:
1. **Layer 1**: Perplexity Research Agent generates initial data
2. **Logic Scoring Layer**: Validates all logic and mathematical consistency
3. **Automatic Regeneration**: If critical failures detected, routes back to Perplexity with specific instructions
4. **Logic Fix Attempt**: First attempts to fix using context, then regenerates if insufficient
5. **Validation Loop**: Continues until logic score meets threshold or maximum attempts reached

**Key Methods Added**:
- `generateLogicRegenerationPrompt()`: Creates specific regeneration instructions
- Logic validation integration in orchestration flow
- Automatic field identification for regeneration

## 3. Specific Logic Issues Addressed

### ✅ Market Size Inconsistency Detection
**Example**: Market size $2.1B with 13.5% CAGR, but peak revenue also $2.1B at 28% market share
- **Detection**: Validates CAGR calculation: `Peak Revenue = Market Size × (1 + CAGR)^years`
- **Expected**: With 13.5% CAGR from $2.1B, expected peak revenue ~$4.5B
- **Action**: Automatically flags as critical failure and regenerates

### ✅ PRV Eligibility Logic Enforcement
**Example**: Patient count >200,000 but PRV potential listed with 0% chance
- **Detection**: Enforces binary FDA regulation
- **Rule**: If `peakPatients2030 > 200,000`: `prvEligibility = "Not eligible"`, `rareDiseaseEligibility = false`
- **Rule**: If `peakPatients2030 < 200,000`: `prvEligibility = "Eligible"`, `rareDiseaseEligibility = true`
- **Action**: Detects contradictions and forces regeneration

### ✅ Mathematical Consistency Validation
**Formulas Validated**:
- Peak Revenue = (peakPatients2030 × avgSellingPrice × peakMarketShare2030) / 1,000,000,000
- Total 10-Year Revenue should be 5-8× Peak Revenue
- CAGR = ((Peak Revenue / Current Market Size)^(1/6) - 1) × 100
- Peak Patients = (Peak Revenue × 1,000,000,000) / (avgSellingPrice × peakMarketShare2030)
- Geographic split must sum to 100%

## 4. System Architecture Improvements

### ✅ Generalization vs Memorization
- **Logic Scoring Layer** generalizes across all pharmaceutical data
- **Field mapping system** identifies related fields for regeneration
- **Mathematical validation** applies industry-standard formulas
- **Business logic rules** enforce FDA regulations and industry standards

### ✅ Systematic Error Handling
- **Critical failure detection** with specific error messages
- **Automatic regeneration routing** with detailed instructions
- **Logic fix attempts** before full regeneration
- **Validation loops** until quality thresholds met

### ✅ Cost Optimization
- **Smart regeneration** only regenerates failed fields
- **Logic fix attempts** reduce expensive Perplexity calls
- **Batch validation** optimizes API usage
- **Early termination** when quality thresholds met

## 5. Testing and Validation

### ✅ Logic Validation Test Suite
**File**: `test-logic-scoring-layer.js`

**Test Cases**:
1. **Market Size Inconsistency**: Successfully detects CAGR calculation errors
2. **PRV Eligibility Contradiction**: Identifies patient count vs eligibility mismatches  
3. **Mathematical Errors**: Validates revenue projections and ratios
4. **Valid Data**: Confirms correct data passes all checks

**Results**: All test cases pass with proper error detection
